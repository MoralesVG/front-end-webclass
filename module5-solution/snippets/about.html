    <h2> About This Website</h2>
    <p>
        It may be hard to tell, but this website does much more than just help you choose a delicious dish from this
        cozy little restaurant. The website of this restaurant has served over 100,000 students all over the world (and
        counting), teaching them the skills of how to develop a website from scratch.

        The development of this website was part of the curriculum of 2 Coursera.org courses: HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        for Web Developers and Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS.
        All courses have an option to be taken for free.

        As of November, 2016, both courses made it to the #1 Top Rated Course spot (among close to 1,800 available
        courses).
